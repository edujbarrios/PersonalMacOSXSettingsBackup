# My Personal Settings Backup 🖥️🔧

This repository contains a "Public Backup" of my personal settings used on my MacOS X device. It's designed to easily adapt a new device to start programming with my own personal workflow. 

The settings include various configurations and presets that I have customized over time to enhance my development experience. These configurations can be especially useful for developers looking to set up their environment quickly with a tried and tested setup.
